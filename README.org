*** Set up Docker
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker attach duckducksnooze_esp32
#+END_SRC

If you run into this error:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Error response from daemon: error gathering device information while adding custom device "/dev/ttyACM0": no such file or directory
#+END_SRC

It's because the ESP32 is not connected to the device. To just build/test the code, the device line can be commented from the docker-compose
*** Change WiFi Credentials
+ Edit ~credentials.h~
+ Probably a good idea to not sync it up with GitHub afterwards.
*** Sending Code to ESP32
You can build the code with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
idf.py build
#+END_SRC

You can flash the code with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
idf.py flash
#+END_SRC

You might need to set the default target with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
idf.py menuconfig
#+END_SRC

NOTE: ~idf.py flash~  builds the code as well, no need to run ~idf.py build~ as well if you just want to flash the code.
